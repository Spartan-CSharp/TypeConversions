# TypeConversions
The homework on Type Conversions from the Common Variables section of the C# Mastercourse from Tim Corey. We are to capture a user's age from the Console and then identify how old they will be in 25 years, as well as how old they were 25 years ago. Print that information to the Console in natural language.
